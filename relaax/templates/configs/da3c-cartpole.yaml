# DA3C configuration for OpenAI Gym CartPole-v0

version: 1.1.0
algorithm:
  name: da3c

  input:
    shape: [4]                    # state: size of the input vector
    history: 1                    # number of consecutive states to stuck to represent an input
    use_convolutions: false       # set to True to use convolutions to process the input

  output:
    continuous: false             # set to True to handle with continuous action type
    action_size: 2                # action size for the given environment

  hidden_sizes: []                # list of num_units for hidden layers
  batch_size: 50                  # maximum batch size, which need to accumulate for one update

  use_lstm: false                 # to use LSTM instead of FF, set to the True
  max_global_step: 30000          # amount of maximum global steps to pass through the training

  rewards_gamma: 0.99             # rewards discount factor

  initial_learning_rate: 2e-2     # initial learning rate to start the training
  use_linear_schedule: True       # set to True to use linear learning rate annealing wrt max_global_step

  optimizer: RMSProp              # type of optimizer to use: Adam | RMSProp
  RMSProp:
    decay: 0.99
    epsilon: 0.1
