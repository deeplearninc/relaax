# generic DA3C configuration

version: 1.1.0
algorithm:
  name: da3c                      # short name for algorithm to load

  input:
    shape: [0]                    # shape of input state, [0] means empty state (bandit env)
    history: 1                    # number of consecutive states to stack
    use_convolutions: false       # set to true to process input by convolution layers

  output:
    continuous: false             # set to true to switch to continuous action space
    loss_type: Normal             # choose loss_type by name for continuous action space
    action_size: 4                # action size for the given environment
    action_high: []               # upper boundary for clipping continuous action
    action_low: []                # lower boundary for clipping continuous action
    scale: 1.0                    # multiplier to scale continuous output

  hidden_sizes: []                # list of dense layers sizes, for ex. [128, 64]
  batch_size: 100                 # maximum batch size, which need to accumulate for one update

  use_lstm: false                 # to use LSTM instead of FF, set to the True
  max_global_step: 30000          # amount of maximum global steps to pass through the training

  rewards_gamma: 0.99             # rewards discount factor

  initial_learning_rate: 2e-2     # initial learning rate, which can be anneal by some procedure
  gradients_norm_clipping: false  # gradients clipping by global norm, if false then it is ignored
  optimizer: Adam                 # name of optimizer to use within training
