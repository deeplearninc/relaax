# generic TRPO configuration, which is fitted to default deepmind-lab or vizdoom environment from templates

version: 1.1.0
algorithm:
  name: trpo
  subtype: trpo-d2

  input:
    shape: [0]                    # shape of input state, [0] means empty state (bandit env)
    use_convolutions: false       # set to True to use convolutions to process the input

  output:
    continuous: false             # set to True to handle with continuous action type
    action_size: 4                # action size for the given environment

  hidden_sizes: [10]              # list of num_units for hidden layers
  activation: tanh                # activation function for MLP

  use_filter: false               # use average filter of the incoming observations and rewards
  async: false                    # set to true to collect experience without blocking the updater

  PG_OPTIONS:
    timestep_limit: 200           # length in steps for one round in environment
    n_iter: 10000                 # number of updates to pass through the training (training length)
    timesteps_per_batch: 5000     # number of experience to collect before update
    rewards_gamma: 0.995          # rewards discount factor
    gae_lambda: 0.97              # lambda from generalized advantage estimation

  TRPO:
    cg_damping: 0.1               # multiple of the identity to Fisher matrix during CG
    max_kl: 0.01                  # KL divergence between old and new policy
